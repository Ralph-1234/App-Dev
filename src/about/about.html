        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <img>
        <p>I'm a computer science student. My journey so far has been filled with constant coding and learning different
             languages such as Python and Java. I'm also learning about databases as part of my curriculum. In addition,
              the projects and assignments from OOP, AppDev, Database Management, and Project Management helped me to 
              grow my technical skills.</p>
