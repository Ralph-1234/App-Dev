        <p>I'm a computer science student. My journey so far has been filled with constant coding and 
            learning different languagesâ€”from building projects to completing assignments. As a second-year student,
            I'm still learning and adapting in software development. The progress I've made through the challenges 
            I've faced has been one of the best and most rewarding experiences of my journey to step further
            and improve my skills.</p>
